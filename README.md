# Woocommerce additional product identifiers
This little helper plugin adds missing Product identifiers to Woocommerce products. It will add 4 important product identifiers Brand, MPN, UPC, EAN, GTIN to simple and variabel products required for sales channels

This will make it easier for the customers from woocommerce product feed manager (wpmarketingrobot.com) to add the important product identifiers to their Woocommerce webshop and are able to select the identifiers in our Product Feed Manager.

Next to the Product identifiers we have added a optimised title field so you can create special optimized titles to your products and use them in you feeds.
